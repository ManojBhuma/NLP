Abstract:
Everybody  in  todayâ€™s  world  is  expressivein  one  way  or  another.  Each  day  on  average  one  filmis  released,  people  are  more  interested  to  know  thesummary  of  the  film.  Often  social  media  or  blogs  haveratings  of  their  kind  of  films.  The  content  on  thesereviews is unstructured, and we need to pre-process themfirst,  and  then  extract  features  from  the  pre-processingresults.  This  model  uses  some  of  the  deep  learning-based  techniques  to  conduct  a  multi-class  analysis  ofsentiment. The Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset isa  large  selection  of  movie  reviews.  The  paper  explainsabout  preprocessing  techniques  to  clean  the  data  suchas  tokenization,  punctuations  and  stop  words  removal,stemming  and  lemmatization.  The  paper  also  discussesmethods  to  load  dataset,  train  the  dataset  and  test  thedataset.  The  goal  of  this  model  is  to  minimize  the  lossvalue  and  generate  the  best  accuracy  score.  With  thehelp  of  machine  learning  concepts  model  is  predictingthe  best  values.  We  found  the  sentimental  study  usingNLP  concepts  and  taking  F-Score  and  Accuracy  intoconsideration
