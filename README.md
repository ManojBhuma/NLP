ABSTRACT:   Housing values are calculated based onproperty  location,  size,  locality,  and  other  aspects.This  is  usually  changed  when  the  economy  rises  orfalls. This concept of predicting house prices is vastlyused through many algorithms. This paper studies thehousing  value  prediction  using  NLP  with  the  CNNalgorithm. To improve the accuracy of housing priceprediction,  this  paper  analyzes  the  housing  data  ofCalifornia.  This  data  set  contains  10  columns  and20000 rows each. This paper uses a one-dimensionalconvolutional model to predict the accuracy of housingvalues including the sub plot graph with MSE and R2
